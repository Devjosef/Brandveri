# Database Metrics Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the key metrics, monitoring strategies, and performance indicators for our PostgreSQL database system.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Connection Metrics
- **Active Connections**
  - Current active connections
  - Peak connection count
  - Connection utilization percentage
  - Failed connection attempts
  - Connection pool efficiency

- **Connection Timing**
  - Average connection time
  - Connection timeout frequency
  - Pool queue wait time
  - Connection lifecycle duration

### 2. Query Performance
- **Query Metrics**
  - Average query execution time
  - Slow query count (>1s)
  - Query cache hit ratio
  - Number of prepared statements
  - Query throughput (queries/second)

- **Transaction Metrics**
  - Transaction rate
  - Average transaction duration
  - Rollback frequency
  - Dead tuple count
  - VACUUM effectiveness

### 3. Resource Utilization
- **Memory Usage**
  - Shared buffer utilization
  - Work memory usage
  - Maintenance work memory
  - Effective cache size usage
  - Memory context statistics

- **Storage Metrics**
  - Database size growth rate
  - Table sizes and growth
  - Index sizes and ratios
  - WAL generation rate
  - Temporary file usage

### 4. System Health
- **Availability Metrics**
  - Uptime percentage
  - Planned/unplanned downtime
  - Replication lag
  - Backup success rate
  - Recovery time objectives (RTO)

- **Error Rates**
  - Deadlock occurrences
  - Lock timeout frequency
  - Statement timeout frequency
  - Constraint violations
  - Foreign key violations

## Monitoring Implementation

### 1. Real-time Monitoring
```sql
-- Active sessions monitoring
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active';

-- Long-running queries
SELECT pid, now() - query_start as duration, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' 
AND now() - query_start > interval '1 second';
```

### 2. Performance Dashboards
- **Grafana Panels**
  - Connection pool status
  - Query performance trends
  - Resource utilization graphs
  - Error rate visualization
  - Storage growth projections

### 3. Alert Thresholds
- **Critical Alerts**
  - Connection pool saturation: >90%
  - Query duration: >10s
  - Storage utilization: >85%
  - Replication lag: >30s
  - Error rate: >1% of requests

- **Warning Alerts**
  - Connection pool utilization: >75%
  - Query duration: >5s
  - Storage utilization: >75%
  - Replication lag: >10s
  - Error rate: >0.5% of requests

## Metric Collection Methods

### 1. Built-in Statistics
- pg_stat_database
- pg_stat_user_tables
- pg_stat_statements
- pg_stat_activity
- pg_stat_bgwriter

### 2. Custom Metrics
```sql
-- Table bloat estimation
WITH constants AS (
  SELECT current_setting('block_size')::numeric AS bs
)
SELECT 
  schemaname, tablename, 
  pg_size_pretty(bloat_size) as bloat_size,
  round(bloat_ratio::numeric, 2) as bloat_ratio
FROM pgstattuple_approx('your_table');
```

### 3. Automated Health Checks
```sql
-- Index health check
SELECT 
  schemaname, tablename, indexname,
  idx_scan, idx_tup_read,
  idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
AND idx_tup_read = 0;
```

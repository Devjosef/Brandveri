# Database Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The system uses PostgreSQL as its primary database, implemented through Sequelize ORM with TypeScript. The architecture follows a robust and scalable design pattern with emphasis on data integrity, security, and performance.

## Core Components

### 1. Database Configuration
- Environment-based configuration (development, test, production).
- Connection pooling with optimized settings.
- Automatic retries and error handling.
- SSL support for production environments.

### 2. Model Architecture

#### Core Models
1. **User**
   - Central entity for user management
   - Secure password handling with bcrypt
   - Role-based access control
   - Extensive validation for credentials

2. **Session**
   - Secure token-based authentication
   - Token rotation mechanism
   - Activity tracking
   - IP and user agent logging

3. **Audit & Logging**
   - `ApiLog`: API request tracking
   - `AuditLog`: User action auditing
   - `TrademarkLog`: Trademark-specific actions
   - `CopyrightLog`: Copyright-specific actions
   - `RecommendationLog`: Recommendation system actions

4. **Business Logic Models**
   - `TrademarkSearch`: Trademark search functionality
   - `Copyright`: Copyright management
   - `Subscription`: Subscription handling
   - `Payment`: Payment processing
   - `Invoice`: Billing management
   - `Recommendation`: AI-powered recommendations

### 3. Database Indexing Strategy
- UUID-based primary keys
- GIN indexes for JSONB fields
- Composite indexes for frequent queries
- B-tree indexes for standard fields

### 4. Data Relationships

User --> Subscription
User --> Payment

User --> Notification
User --> UserPreference
TrademarkSearch --> TrademarkLog
Copyright --> CopyrightLog
Subscription --> Payment
Subscription --> Invoice 
```

### 5. Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token-based session management
- IP address tracking
- User agent logging
- Audit logging for all critical operations

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling
  - Max connections: 20 (dev), 50 (prod)
  - Minimum connections: 5
  - Acquisition timeout: 60s
  - Idle timeout: 10s

- Query Timeouts
  - Statement timeout: 1s
  - Transaction idle timeout: 10s

- Indexing Strategy
  - GIN indexes for JSON fields
  - B-tree indexes for lookup fields
  - Composite indexes for common queries

### 7. Maintenance Operations
- Automated backups with retention policies
- Connection health monitoring
- Migration management system
- Database synchronization with retry mechanisms

## Database Migration System
- Umzug-based migration framework
- Transaction-wrapped migrations
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Version control for schema changes

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Connection attempts tracking
- Operation duration measurements
- Error rate monitoring
- Backup success/failure metrics

## Error Handling
- Automatic retry mechanism
- Exponential backoff strategy
- Detailed error logging
- Transaction rollback guarantees

## Best Practices Implementation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper data type selection
- Normalized schema design
- Efficient indexing strategies
- Transaction management
- Audit logging
